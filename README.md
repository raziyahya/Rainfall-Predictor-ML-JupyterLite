# Rainfall-Predictor-ML-JupyterLite
Explore rainfall prediction with machine learning using JupyterLite notebooks.

Here, a project for weather forecasting by building a classifier to predict whether we can expect rain the next day. The dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, and the journey begins with data cleaning and thorough exploration.

Our goal is to use the capabilities of machine learning and employ five diverse classification algorithms to this challenge:

1. Linear Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Our aim is to identify the most accurate and dependable model for predicting rain. Along the way, evaluating the models using a range of performance metrics that make sense of their predictions, including Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, Log Loss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R2-Score.
